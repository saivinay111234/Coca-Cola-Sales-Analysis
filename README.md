Unlocking Coca-Cola's 2022 Sales and Profitability Insights with Data Analytics ðŸš€ðŸ“Š



# Description:

About Coca-Cola: The Coca-Cola Company, founded in 1892, has grown to become a global leader in the beverage industry. With a rich history of innovation and market expansion, Coca-Cola's product portfolio includes iconic brands like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, and Dasani Water. The company's commitment to refreshing the world has driven its success for over a century.



# Project Overview: 

In an effort to understand and optimize Coca-Cola's sales and profitability, I embarked on a data analysis project using the company's 2022 sales data. This project aimed to uncover key insights that can inform strategic decisions and drive business growth.



# Key Highlights:

1. Retailer Performance:

Walmart leads in total sales with $1.2M but lags in operating profit with $80,000. Target shows the highest operational efficiency with an operating profit of $200,000.

2. Regional Insights:

The Southeast region emerges as the most profitable with $500,000 in operating profit, while the Midwest shows room for improvement with $250,000 in operating profit.

3. Temporal Trends:

Significant seasonal peaks in sales during July ($200,000) and December ($220,000). Strategies are needed to boost sales in Q1 ($150,000) and Q3 ($160,000).

4. Product Line Performance:

Coca-Cola and Dasani Water are top sellers with total sales of $500,000 and $450,000 respectively. Focused efforts are required to boost lower-performing products like Fanta ($200,000) and Powerade ($150,000).

5. Profit Margin Analysis:

Walmart tops in profit margin with $83,810, followed by CVS with $24,480. Target has the lowest margin with $5,520, indicating potential areas for cost optimization and sales strategies.

6. Stock Price Correlation:

Weak positive correlations between Coca-Cola's stock price and sales metrics: Total Sales and Adj Close (0.27), Price per Unit and Adj Close (0.26).



# What I Learned:

Data visualization is powerful in uncovering hidden insights and driving strategic decisions. Each retailer and region has unique performance patterns that require tailored strategies. Understanding seasonal trends can significantly enhance marketing and sales efforts.



# Tools Used:

Jupyter Notebook: For data cleaning, manipulation, and EDA. ðŸ“š 

Power BI: For creating interactive and insightful dashboards. ðŸ“ˆ 



# Next Steps:

1. Dive deeper into the reasons behind the variations in profit margins across retailers.

2. Develop targeted marketing strategies for underperforming products and regions.

3. Monitor seasonal trends to optimize promotional activities and inventory management.
